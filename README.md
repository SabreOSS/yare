## _YARE_ - Rules Engine in Plain Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SabreOSS/yare.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SabreOSS/yare)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.sabre.oss.yare/yare/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.sabre.oss.yare/yare)

**YARE** (**Y**et **A**nother **R**ules **E**ngine) is a rule engine written in Java.
It is an approach to implement an Expert System which is reliable, fast and full of capabilities.


#### Why Yet Another Rules Engine?

Beyond the advantages of business rules engines YARE makes its own contribution to user experience:

* YARE is significantly faster than other rules engines for single-type collection input (e.q. List\<Flight\>).
* YARE allows for sequential evaluation, which is useful when it comes to modifying facts during execution.
* YARE allows for function evaluation in condition segment of rule.
* YARE is using three-valued logic (true/false/null).
* YARE provides rule converters for XML, JSON and YAML.

## Getting Started

To start playing with _YARE_ just add the dependency to _com.sabre.oss.yare:yare-engine_:

_Maven_
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sabre.oss.yare</groupId>
    <artifactId>yare-engine</artifactId>
    <version>${yare.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

_Gradle_
```groovy
dependencies {
  compile "com.sabre.oss.yare:yare-engine:$yareVersion"
}
```

## Example

First step towards evaluation using the rule engine is to define a rule.

We can do it using:
* Java DSL
```java
Rule rule = RuleDsl.ruleBuilder()
                .name("Should match flight with first class of service")
                .fact("flightFact", com.sabre.oss.yare.example.fact.Flight.class)
                .predicate(
                        equal(
                                value("${flightFact.classOfService}"),
                                value("First Class")
                        )
                )
                .action("collect",
                        param("context", value("${ctx}")),
                        param("fact", value("${flightFact}")))
                .build();
```

* XML
```xml
<Rule xmlns="http://www.sabre.com/schema/oss/yare/rules/v1">
    <Attribute name="ruleName" value="Should match flight with first class of service" type="String"/>
    <Fact name="flightFact" type="com.sabre.oss.yare.example.fact.Flight"/>
    <Predicate>
        <Operator type="equal">
            <Value>${flightFact.classOfService}</Value>
            <Value>First Class</Value>
        </Operator>
    </Predicate>
    <Action name="collect">
        <Parameter name="context">
            <Value>${ctx}</Value>
        </Parameter>
        <Parameter name="fact">
            <Value>${flightFact}"</Value>
        </Parameter>
    </Action>
</Rule>
```

* JSON
```json
{
  "attributes" : [ {
    "name" : "ruleName",
    "value" : "Should match flight with first class of service",
    "type" : "String"
  } ],
  "facts" : [ {
    "name" : "flightFact",
    "type" : "com.sabre.oss.yare.example.fact.Flight"
  } ],
  "predicate" : {
    "equal" : [ {
      "value" : "${flightFact.classOfService}"
    }, {
      "value" : "First Class"
    } ]
  },
  "actions" : [ {
    "name" : "collect",
    "parameters" : [ {
      "name" : "context",
      "value" : "${ctx}"
    }, {
      "name" : "fact",
      "value" : "${flightFact}"
    } ]
  } ]
}
```

* YAML
```yaml
attributes:
- name: "ruleName"
  value: "Should match flight with first class of service"
  type: "String"
facts:
- name: "flightFact"
  type: "com.sabre.oss.yare.example.fact.Flight"
predicate:
  equal:
  - value: "${flightFact.classOfService}"
  - value: "First Class"
actions:
- name: "collect"
  parameters:
  - name: "context"
    value: "${ctx}"
  - name: "fact"
    value: "${flightFact}"
```

As you can see we operate on `Flight` fact so let's define it too.
```java
public class Flight {
        private String destination;
        private String classOfService;

        // getters and setters
}
```

Since we are using `collect` action we have to provide implementation as well.
```java
public class Action {
        public void collect(List<Flight> result, Flight fact) {
            result.add(fact);
        }
}
```

Last, but certainly not least, we need to create the rules engine itself.
Exactly as shown below.
```java
RulesEngine rulesEngine = new RulesEngineBuilder()
                .withRulesRepository((uri) -> Collections.singletonList(rule))
                .withActionMapping("collect", method(new Action(), (action) -> action.collect(null, null)))
                .build()
```

The only thing left is to evaluate our example.
```java
RuleSession ruleSession = rulesEngine.createSession("ruleSet");
List<Flight> result = ruleSession.execute(new ArrayList(), flights);
```
